# Customer Transaction Prediction

## Description
This project aims to create a predictive model to identify which customers will make transactions in the future. The dataset contains anonymized features along with a target column indicating whether a customer will make a transaction (1) or not (0).

## Tasks
- Task 1: Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.
- Task 2: Create a predictive model to identify customers likely to make transactions in the future.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found [here](https://d3ilbtxij3aepc.cloudfront.net/projects/CDS-Capstone-Projects/PRCP-1003-CustTransPred.zip). It includes the following columns:
- ID_code: Customer ID
- Features: Anonymized features (200 in total)
- Target: Binary column indicating whether a customer will make a transaction (1) or not (0)

## Tasks
### Task 1: Data Analysis Report
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of data distributions, correlations, etc. (if applicable)

### Task 2: Model Creation and Comparison
- Train multiple machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Select the best model for production

## Challenges Faced
- Lack of feature names due to anonymization
- Dealing with high-dimensional data
- Imbalanced dataset (if applicable)
- Model interpretability

## Model Comparison Report
- Performance comparison of multiple models
- Selection of the best model for production based on performance metrics

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
4. Open and run the `Customer_Transaction_Prediction.ipynb` notebook.
